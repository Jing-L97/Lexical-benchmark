# Machine CDI: Lexical-benchmark for language acquisition

This repository focuses on a detailed comparison between human(CDI) and model performance at the lexical level, including: 

1) Receptive Vocabulary using a spot-the-word task (adapted from [BabySLM](https://github.com/MarvinLvn/BabySLM)

2) Expressive Vocabulary using (un)prompted generations
